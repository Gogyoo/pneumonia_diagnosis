# Detect Pneumonia from X-ray Scans

We are using the [Chest X-Ray Images- Pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia‚Äù) dataset from Kaggle to train a CNN-based model for pneumonia detection. The dataset splits pneumonia into two categories: bacteria and viral.
The model does not differentiate between these two categories.

### X-ray example

## Run the LungDetect API

 1. Clone this repository to your local disk.
 2. Run the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
 3. Run the `fastapi.py` script using `uvicorn pneumonia.api.fastapi:app --reload`.
 4. Open (https://anya9889-pneumonia-diagnosis-front-app-mtvurf.streamlit.app/) in your browser.
 5. Choose an x-ray from the test subset and click on the `Submit` button.

## Train and Test

1. Run `preprocessor.py` to load images. Change the paths to location where images is saved.
2. Run `inceptionv3.py` to train InceptionV3 model on the data. The model is trained for 20 epochs to obtain the result. You may train longer.
3. Run `evaluate_model()`function inside `inceptionv3.py` to predict test images.

## Model Deployment
The classification model is deployed with FastAPI and Docker. The endpoint accepts uploaded files and concludes from the image whether the diagnosis probability.
Streamlit is used to create a web application for the API. Alternativel, using the same `uvicorn` command above, [the API](https://api-cwtil3b3qq-ew.a.run.app/) can be tested.

## Results
<p>Using InceptionNet as an implementation of Transfer Learning, we managed an excellent accuracy (97%) and recall (99%). This is important because we want to avoid false negatives (e.g. sending a patient home who is actuall sick). Conversely the model is lenient on false positives (e.g. patients are told they could be sick with pneumonia, but actually aren't) because then the x-ray can be passed on to a health professional for further assessment.</p>
